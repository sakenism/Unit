**List of all projects I validated during my studies at UNIT Factory (ecole 42 Kiev). Projects are written purely in C**
1) **Libft.**
  Huge part of standard libraries of C language is prohibited to use in ecole 42, thereby we must implement own library with     usefull fields and methods. The methods are intended to help me in implementation of Strings, dynamic Memory allocation,       usage of Linked Lists as base for various Data Structure.
  More about the project: <a href="https://github.com/sakenism/Unit/blob/master/libft/libft.en.pdf" target="_blank">Libft</a>
  
2) **GNL.**
  One of the most fundamental things to implement when most of helpful functions are unavailable is **Get Next Line**. Reading   every bit of given data, allocating enough memory, and excluding **Memory leaks** was the main aim of the project.

3) **Fillit.**
  Fillit is the project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming:           searching the optimal solution among a huge set of a possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you   will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.
